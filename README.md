# Lines of Action
A game development project by Nuzhat Hoque, Kyle Monteleone, and myself.

### How this works
Lines of Action is played with two players sharing a keyboard. The player controlling the black pieces goes first. To move a piece, the player first selects the piece they want to move,
 followed by the space they wish to move it to. Legal moves are indicated by a lighter shade of blue. The game then allows the player controlling the white pieces to make their move.

### Objective & Game-winning state
The winner is whoever can eliminate their opponents pieces first. When a player moves a piece onto a space already occupied by their opponent, they capture their piece and it cannot be 
reintroduced in the game.
